<h2>
INTRODUCTION
</h2>

<p>
Observation and imagination are the basic principles of all poetry. It
is impossible to conceive a poetical work from which one of them is
wholly absent. Observation without imagination makes for obviousness;
imagination without observation turns into nonsense. What marks the
world's greatest poetry is perhaps the presence in almost equal
proportion of both these principles. But as a rule we find one of them
predominating, and from this one-sided emphasis the poetry of the
period derives its character as realistic or idealistic.
</p>

<p>
The poetry of the middle nineteenth century made a fetish of
observation. It came as near excluding imagination as it could without
ceasing entirely to be poetry. That such exaggeration should sooner or
later result in a sharp reaction was natural. The change began during
the eighties and gathered full headway in the early nineties.
Imagination, so long scorned, came into its rights once more, and it is
rapidly becoming the dominant note in the literary production of our
own day.
</p>

<p>
The new movement has been called "neo-romantic" and "symbolistic." Both
these names apply, but neither of them exhausts the contents or meaning
of the movement which received its first impetus from Ibsen and which
later found its typical embodiment in Maeterlinck. From this movement
came much of the inspiration that produced the poetical re-birth of
Ireland out of which has sprung the man whom I have now the pleasure of
introducing to American readers: a man with imagination as elfish as
moonlight mist.
</p>

<p>
Edward John Moreton Drax Plunkett, Lord Dunsany, is the eighteenth
member of his family to bear the title which gives him a place in the
Irish peerage. He was born in 1878 and received his education at Eton
and Sandhurst. In 1899 he succeeded his father to the title and the
family estate in Meath, Ireland. During the South African war he served
at the front with the Coldstream Guards. He is passionately fond of
outdoor life and often spends the whole day in the saddle before
sitting down at his desk to write late at night.
</p>

<p>
His work proves, however, that he is as fond of spiritual as of
physical exercise, and that he is an inveterate traveller in those
mysterious regions of the partly known or wholly unknown where the
imagination alone can guide us. His first literary heroes were the
brothers Grimm and Andersen. Then the Greek world of Olympians was
revealed to him, making a lasting impression on his mind. But it was
the Bible that gave him the limpid style which makes his most fantastic
tales as real as government reports&#8212;or rather much more so. "For years
no style seemed to me natural but that of the Bible," he said not long
ago, "and I feared that I would never become a writer when I saw that
other people did not use it."
</p>

<p>
For something like ten years he has been a pretty frequent and
increasingly valued contributor to English and Anglo-Irish periodicals.
He has previously published five volumes: "The Gods of Pegana," 1905;
"Time and the Gods," 1906; "The Sword of Welleran," 1908; "A Dreamer's
Tales," 1910; and "The Book of Wonder," 1912. All are collections of
prose pieces that defy accepted classifications. They are fairy tales
and short stories and essays and prose poems at the same time.
</p>

<p>
The reader has only to take a brief glance at one of those works to
make the astounding discovery that he is being introduced to worlds of
which he has never heard before. Even the "Arabian Nights" have a
clearly identifiable background of popular legend and myth. Nothing of
the kind is to be found in the writings of Lord Dunsany. He may be said
to have created a new mythology wholly his own. He is not only the
master but the maker of the countries to which he takes us on such
fascinating jaunts. His commonest name for them is the Edge of the
World, but sometimes he speaks of them as the Lands of Wonder. This
latter name is doubly significant, for the whole movement of which he
forms such a striking manifestation has been defined as a "renascence
of wonder."
</p>

<p>
The names of places and persons appearing in the stories of Lord
Dunsany are worth a study in themselves. There are hundreds of them,
giving evidence of an inexhaustible imagination; and each one of them
is as aptly suggestive as if generations of men had been at work
shaping them. To hear of Sardathion, the city built by the Gods of Old,
is to see its domes of marble rising sky-high in the sunset-lighted
air. To hear of Slith and Sippy and Slorg, the three thieves who went
to the Edge of the World in quest of the Golden Box, is to feel as if
one were dealing with historical characters like Aaron Burr or Chinese
Gordon. And as we learn more about them, these fanciful creatures of
Lord Dunsany's brain assume still more familiar characteristics, as if
they had been studied in some Irish village or English street. It is
this fact that reveals one of the main secrets of Lord Dunsany's
appeal: that behind all his exuberant imagination lies a solid basis of
observation, enabling him to endow the most impossible adventures with
a homely and convincing air.
</p>

<p>
The five plays contained in the present volume have all been produced
on the stage. "The Golden Doom" and "The Gods of the Mountain" have
been staged most successfully at the Haymarket Theatre, London. "King
Argim&#275;n&#275;s" and "The Glittering Gate" have been given by the Irish
Players, and "The Lost Silk Hat" has been put on by Iden Payne at
Manchester. In America, the first three have been in the repertoire of
Stuart Walker's Portmanteau Theatre, and "The Glittering Gate" has been
given by the Neighborhood Players.
</p>

<p>
After seeing "The Gods of the Mountain," Frank Harris wrote: "It was
one of the nights of my life; the only play, I said to myself, which
meant anything to me in twenty years or more." Without sharing the
opinion of Mr. Harris about the dramatic output of the last twenty
years, I share fully his enthusiasm in regard to the play that caused
his remark. The note struck in it is so distinctly new as to make one
gasp as under a sharp shock. But the surprise turns quickly into
pleasure such as only the originality of genius can confer.
</p>

<p>
It is hard to define just what makes these plays what they are. But
certain qualities are tangible. Their deep and rich symbolism is one.
It is the kind of symbolism for which the advances of modern psychology
had prepared us&#8212;the kind that is inseparable from life itself as we
are only just beginning to understand it. Another quality is their
capacity for suggesting at once the intimate unity and appalling
vastness of life. In "The Golden Doom" the fate of an empire and a
little boy's desire for a new plaything become linked as facts of equal
importance in the web of fate. In "The Gods of the Mountain" we meet
with an atmosphere of fatality comparable only to that found in the
Greek dramas. The crime of <i>hybris</i>, which to the Greeks was the
"unforgivable sin," is here made as real to us as it was to them.
</p>

<p>
But these remarks of mine about the inner significance of the plays
should not tempt anybody into thinking them deficient in that element
of formal perfection without which they could not be classed as works
of art. They are, indeed, "things of beauty," and their beauty inheres
in their design as well as in their style. Through all of them the
greatest possible economy of means has been observed, so that not a
word, not a tone, not a gesture is wasted in obtaining the effect aimed
at. The dialogue of Maeterlinck is suggested, but not more than
suggested. The words spoken by the characters of Maeterlinck are often
so vague as to be practically meaningless. The characters of Lord
Dunsany speak as simply as those of Maeterlinck, but always sharply to
the point; there can be no mistaking of what they mean, and that
meaning serves always to carry the action of the play forward. And each
play of Lord Dunsany's is an exciting adventure, conveying to the
reader an exhilarating sense of motion without ever descending to
old-fashioned stage tricks for the production of that sense. This means
that they combine to an extraordinary degree the qualities which make
separately for theatrical or literary success.

<p class="dialogue">
Some evil has befallen the rich ones of this city. They take no joy any
longer in benevolence, but are become sour and miserly at heart. Alas
for them! I sometimes sigh for them when I think of this.
</p>

<p>
OOGNO
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Alas for them! A miserly heart must be a sore affliction.
</p>

<p>
THAHN
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
A sore affliction indeed, and bad for our calling.
</p>

<p>
OOGNO (<i>reflectively</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
They have been thus for many months. What thing has befallen them?
</p>

<p>
THAHN
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Some evil thing.
</p>

<p>
ULF
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
There has been a comet come near to the earth of late and the earth has
been parched and sultry so that the gods are drowsy and all those
things that are divine in man, such as benevolence, drunkenness,
extravagance, and song, have faded and died and have not been
replenished by the gods.
</p>

<p>
OOGNO
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
It has indeed been sultry.
</p>

<p>
THAHN

I have seen the comet o' nights.

The gods are drowsy.

<p>
OOGNO

<p class="dialogue">
If they awake not soon and make this city worthy again of our order I
for one shall forsake the calling and buy a shop and sit at ease in the
shade and barter for gain.

<p>
THAHN
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
You will keep a shop?
</p>

<p class="direction">
[<i>Enter Agmar and Slag. Agmar, though poorly dressed, is tall,

Is this a beggar who speaks?
</p>

<p>
OOGNO
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Yes, master, a poor beggar.
</p>

<p>
AGMAR
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
How long has the calling of beggary existed?
</p>

<p>
OOGNO
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Since the building of the first city, master.
</p>

<p>
AGMAR
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
And when has a beggar ever followed a trade? When has he ever haggled
and bartered and sat in a shop?
</p>

<p>
OOGNO
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Why, he has never done so.
</p>

<p>
AGMAR
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Are you he that shall be first to forsake the calling?
</p>

<p>
OOGNO
</p>

Times are bad for the calling here.

<p>
THAHN

<p class="dialogue">
They are bad.
</p>

<p>
AGMAR
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
So you would forsake the calling?
</p>

<p>
OOGNO
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
The city is unworthy of our calling. The gods are drowsy and all that
is divine in man is dead. (<i>To third beggar</i>) Are not the gods
drowsy?
</p>

<p>
ULF
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
They are drowsy in their mountains away at Marma. The seven green idols
are drowsy. Who is this that rebukes us?

<p>
THAHN

<p class="dialogue">
Are you some great merchant, master? Perhaps you will help a poor man
that is starving.
</p>

<p>
SLAG

<p class="dialogue">
My master a merchant! No, no. He is no merchant. My master is no
merchant.
</p>

<p>
OOGNO
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
I perceive that he is some lord in disguise. The gods have woken and
have sent him to save us.
</p>

<p>
SLAG
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
No, no. You do not know my master. You do not know him.
</p>

<p>
THAHN
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Is he the Soldan's self that has come to rebuke us?
</p>

<p>
AGMAR
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
I am a beggar, and an old beggar.
</p>

<p>SLAG (<i>with great pride</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
There is none like my master. No traveller has met with cunning like to
his, not even those that come from &#198;thiopia.
</p>

<p>
ULF
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
We make you welcome to our town, upon which an evil has fallen, the
days being bad for beggary.
</p>

<p>
AGMAR
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Let none who has known the mystery of roads or has felt the wind
arising new in the morning, or who has called forth out of the souls of
men divine benevolence, ever speak any more of any trade or of the
miserable gains of shops and the trading men.
</p>

<p>
OOGNO
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
I but spoke hastily, the times being bad.
</p>

<p>
AGMAR
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
I will put right the times.
</p>

<p>
SLAG
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
There is nothing that my master cannot do.
</p>

<p>
AGMAR (<i>to Slag</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Be silent and attend to me. I do not know this city. I have travelled
from far, having somewhat exhausted the city of Ackara.
</p>

<p>
SLAG
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
My master was three times knocked down and injured by carriages there,
once he was killed and seven times beaten and robbed, and every time he
was generously compensated. He had nine diseases, many of them mortal&#8212;

AGMAR

<p class="dialogue">
Be silent, Slag.&#8212;Have you any thieves among the calling here?
</p>

<p>
ULF
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
We have a few that we call thieves here, master, but they would
scarcely seem thieves to you. They are not good thieves.
</p>

<p>
AGMAR
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
I shall need the best thief you have.
</p>

<p class="direction">
[<i>Enter two citizens richly clad, Illanaun and Oorander.</i>

<p>
ILLANAUN
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Therefore we will send galleons to Ardaspes.

<p>
OORANDER
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Right to Ardaspes through the silver gates.
</p>

<p class="direction">
[<i>Agmar transfers the thick handle of his long staff to his left
armpit, he droops on to it and it supports his weight; he is upright no
longer. His right arm hangs limp and useless. He hobbles up to the
citizens imploring alms.</i>
</p>

<p>
ILLANAUN
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
I am sorry. I cannot help you. There have been too many beggars here
and we must decline alms for the good of the town.

AGMAR (<i>sitting down and weeping</i>)
</p>

I have come from far.

We shall need fine raiment; let the thief start at once. Let it rather
be green raiment.

<p>
BEGGAR
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
I will go and fetch the thief. (<i>Exit</i>)

ULF

<p class="dialogue">
We will dress ourselves as lords and impose upon the city.

OOGNO
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Yes, yes; we will say we are ambassadors from a far land.
</p>

<p>
ULF
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
And there will be good eating.
</p>

<p>
SLAG (<i>in an undertone to Ulf</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
But you do not know my master. Now that you have suggested that we
shall go as lords, he will make a better suggestion. He will suggest
that we should go as kings.

<p>
ULF
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Beggars as kings!

<p>
SLAG
</p>

Ay. You do not know my master.

They are of green jade. They sit cross-legged with their right elbows
resting on their left hands, the right forefinger pointing upward. We
will come into the city disguised, from the direction of Marma, and
will claim to be these gods. We must be seven as they are. And when we
sit we must sit cross-legged as they do, with the right hand uplifted.

Let it be laid here by the iron door where the god came who wrote the

KING ARGIMĒNĒS AND THE UNKNOWN WARRIOR
</p>

<h3>
THE FIRST ACT
</h3>

<p>
<i>The dinner-hour on the slave-fields of King Darniak. King Argimenes
is sitting upon the ground, bowed, ragged and dirty, gnawing a bone. He
has uncouth hair and a dishevelled beard. A battered spade lies near
him. Two or three slaves sit at back of stage eating raw
cabbage-leaves. The tear-song, the chant of the low-born, rises at
intervals, monotonous and mournful, coming from distant
slave-fields.</i>
</p>

<p>
KING ARGIMENES
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
This is a good bone; there is juice in this bone.
</p>

<p>
ZARB
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
I wish I were you, Argimenes.
</p>

<p>
KING ARGIMENES
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
I am not to be envied any longer. I have eaten up my bone.
</p>

<p>
ZARB
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
I wish I were you, because you have been a king. Because men have
prostrated themselves before your feet. Because you have ridden a horse
and worn a crown and have been called Majesty.
</p>

<p>
KING ARGIMENES
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
When I remember that I have been a king it is very terrible.
</p>

<p>
ZARB
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
But you are lucky to have such things in your memory as you have. I
have nothing in my memory&#8212;Once I went for a year without being
flogged, and I remember my cleverness in contriving it&#8212;I have nothing
else to remember.
</p>

<p>
KING ARGIMENES
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
It is very terrible to have been a king.
</p>

<p>
ZARB
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
But we have nothing who have no good memories in the past. It is not
easy for us to hope for the future here.
</p>

<p>
KING ARGIMENES
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Have you any god?
</p>

<p>
ZARB
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
We may not have a god because he might make us brave and we might kill
our guards. He might make a miracle and give us swords.
</p>

<p>
KING ARGIMENES
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Ah, you have no hope, then.
</p>

<p>
ZARB
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
I have a little hope. Hush, and I will tell you a secret&#8212;The King's
great dog is ill and like to die. They will throw him to us. We shall
have beautiful bones then.
</p>

<p>
KING ARGIMENES
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Ah! Bones.
</p>

<p>
ZARB
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Yes. That is what <em>I</em> hope for. And have <em>you</em> no other hope?
Do you not hope that your nation will arise some day and rescue you and
cast off the king and hang him up by his thumbs from the palace
gateway?
</p>

<p>
KING ARGIMENES
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
No. I have no other hope, for my god was cast down in the temple and
broken into three pieces on the day that they surprised us and took me
sleeping. But will they throw him to us? Will so honorable a brute as
the King's dog be thrown to us?
</p>

<p>
ZARB
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
When he is dead his honors are taken away. Even the King when he is
dead is given to the worms. Then why should not his dog be thrown to
us?
</p>

<p>
KING ARGIMENES
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
We are not worms!
</p>

<p>
ZARB
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
You do not understand, Argimenes. The worms are little and free, while
we are big and enslaved. I did not say we were worms, but we are
<i>like</i> worms, and if they have the King when he is dead, why
then&#8212;
</p>

<p>
KING ARGIMENES
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Tell me more of the King's dog. Are there big bones on him?
</p>

<p>
ZARB
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Ay, he is a big dog&#8212;a high, big, black one.
</p>

<p>
KING ARGIMENES
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
You know him then?
</p>

<p>
ZARB
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Oh yes, I know him. I know him well. I was beaten once because of him,
twenty-five strokes from the treble whips, two men beating me.
</p>

<p>
KING ARGIMENES
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
How did they beat you because of the King's dog?
</p>

<p>
ZARB
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
They beat me because I spoke to him without making obeisance. He was
coming dancing along over the slave-fields and I spoke to him. He was a
friendly great dog, and I spoke to him and patted his head, and did not
make obeisance.
</p>

<p>
KING ARGIMENES
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
And they saw you do it?
</p>

<p>
ZARB
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Yes, the slave-guard saw me. They came and seized me at once and bound
my arms. The great dog wanted me to speak to him again, but I was
hurried away.
</p>

<p>
KING ARGIMENES
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
You should have made obeisance.
</p>

<p>
ZARB
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
The great dog seemed so friendly that I forgot he was the King's great
dog.
</p>

<p>
KING ARGIMENES
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
But tell me more. Was he hurt or is it a sickness?
</p>

<p>
ZARB
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
They say that it is a sickness.
</p>

<p>
KING ARGIMENES
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Ah, then he will grow thin if he does not die soon. If it had been a
hurt!&#8212;but we should not complain. I complain more often than you do
because I had not learned to submit while I was yet young.
</p>

<p>
ZARB
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
If your beautiful memories do not please you, you should hope more. I
wish I had your memories. I should not trouble to hope then. It is very
hard to hope.
</p>

<p>
KING ARGIMENES
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
There will be nothing more to hope for when we have eaten the King's
dog.
</p>

<p>
ZARB
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Why, you might find gold in the earth while you were digging. Then you
might bribe the commander of the guard to lend you his sword; we would
all follow you if you had a sword. Then we might take the King and bind
him and lay him on the ground and fasten his tongue outside his mouth
with thorns and put honey on it and sprinkle honey near. Then the gray
ants would come from one of their big mounds. My father found gold once
when he was digging.
</p>

<p>
KING ARGIMENES (<i>pointedly</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Did your father free himself?
</p>

<p>
ZARB
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
No. Because the King's Overseer found him looking at the gold and
killed him. But he would have freed himself if he could have bribed the
guard.
</p>

<p class="direction">
[<i>A Prophet walks across the stage attended by two guards.</i>

SLAVES

He is going to the King. He is going to the King.

<p>
ZARB
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
He is going to the King.
</p>

<p>
KING ARGIMENES
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Going to prophesy good things to the King. It is easy to prophesy good
things to a king, and be rewarded when the good things come. What else
should come to a king? A prophet! A prophet!
</p>

[<i>A deep bell tolls slowly. King Argimenes and Zarb pick up their
spades at once, and the old slaves at the back of the stage go down on
their knees immediately and grub in the soil with their hands. The
white beard of the oldest trails in the dirt as he works. King
Argimenes digs.</i>
</p>

<p>
KING ARGIMENES
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
What is the name of that song that we always sing? I like the song.
</p>

<p>
ZARB
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
It has no name. It is our song. There is no other song.
</p>

<p>
KING ARGIMENES
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Once there were other songs. Has this no name?
</p>

<p>
ZARB
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
I think the soldiers have a name for it.
</p>

<p>
KING ARGIMENES
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
What do the soldiers call it?
</p>

<p>
ZARB
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
The soldiers call it the tear-song, the chant of the low-born.
</p>

<p>
KING ARGIMENES
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
It is a good song. I could sing no other now.
</p>

<p class="direction">

<p>
KING ARGIMENES (<i>to himself as his spade touches something
in the earth</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Metal! (<i>Feels with his spade again</i>) Gold perhaps!&#8212;It is of no
use here. (<i>Uncovers earth leisurely. Suddenly he drops on his knees
and works excitedly in the earth with his hands. Then very slowly,
still kneeling, he lifts, lying flat on his hands, a long greenish
sword, his eyes intent on it. About the level of his uplifted forehead
he holds it, still flat on both hands, and addresses it thus</i>) O
holy and blessed thing! (<i>Then he lowers it slowly till his hands
rest on his knees, and looking all the while at the sword,
loquitur</i>) Three years ago to-morrow King Darniak spat at me, having
taken my kingdom from me. Three times in that year I was flogged, with
twelve stripes, with seventeen stripes, and with twenty stripes. A year
and eleven months ago, come Moon-day, the King's Overseer struck me in
the face, and nine times in that year he called me dog. For one month
two weeks and a day I was yoked with a bullock and pulled a rounded
stone all day over the paths, except while we were fed. I was flogged
twice that year&#8212;with eighteen stripes and with ten stripes. This year
the roof of the slave-sty has fallen in and King Darniak will not
repair it. Five weeks ago one of his Queens laughed at me as she came
across the slave-fields. I was flogged again this year and with
thirteen stripes, and twelve times they have called me dog. And these
things they have done to a king, and a king of the House of
Ithara.(<i>He listens attentively for a moment, then buries the sword
again and pats the earth over it with his hands, then digs again</i>)
</p>

[<i>The old slaves do not see him: their faces are to the earth. Enter
the King's Overseer carrying a whip. The slaves and King Argimenes
kneel with their foreheads to the ground as he passes across the stage.

<p>
KING ARGIMENES (<i>kneeling, hands outspread downward</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
O warrior spirit, wherever thou wanderest, whoever be thy gods, whether
they punish thee or whether they bless thee, O kingly spirit, that once
laid here this sword, behold, I pray to thee, having no gods to pray
to, for the god of my nation was broken in three by night. Mine arm is
stiff with three years' slavery, and remembers not the sword. But guide
thy sword till I have slain six men and armed the strongest slaves, and
thou shalt have the sacrifice every year of a hundred goodly oxen. And
I will build in Ithara a temple to thy memory wherein all that enter in
shall remember thee; so shalt thou be honored and envied among the
dead, for the dead are very jealous of remembrance. Ay, though thou
wert a robber that took men's lives unrighteously, yet shall rare
spices smoulder in thy temple and little maidens sing and new-plucked
flowers deck the solemn aisles; and priests shall go about it ringing
bells that thy soul shall find repose. Oh, but it has a good blade,
this old green sword; thou wouldst not like to see it miss its mark (if
the dead see at all, as wise men teach), thou wouldst not like to see
it go thirsting into the air; so huge a sword should find its marrowy
bone. (<i>Extending his right hand upward</i>) Come into my right arm,
O ancient spirit, O unknown warrior's soul! And if thou hast the ear of
any gods, speak there against Illuriel, god of King Darniak. (<i>He
rises and goes on digging</i>)

slave to pray.

<p class="dialogue">
I did but pray to Illuriel to make me a good slave, to teach me to dig
well and to pull the rounded stone and to make me not to die when the
food is scarce, but to be a good slave to my master the great King.

How do you know?

ZARB

<p class="dialogue">
Because whenever their officer leaves them they sit upon the ground and
play with dice.

No, Argimenes.

<p>
KING ARGIMENES
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Why would they not follow me?
</p>

<p>
ZARB
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Because you look like a slave. They will never follow a slave, because
they are slaves themselves, and know how mean a creature is a slave. If
you looked like a king they would follow you.

But I am a king. They know that I am a king.

If I had a sword would they follow me? A beautiful huge sword of
bronze.
</p>

<p>
ZARB

<p class="dialogue">
I wish I could think of things like that. It is because you were once a
king that you can think of a sword of bronze. I tried to hope once that
I should some day fight the guards, but I couldn't picture a sword, I
couldn't imagine it; I could only picture whips.

Dig a little nearer, Zarb. (<i>They both edge closer</i>) I have found
a very old sword in the earth. It is not a sword such as common
soldiers wear. A king must have worn it, and an angry king. It must
have done fearful things; there are little dints in it. Perhaps there
was a battle here long ago where all were slain, and perhaps that king
died last and buried his sword, but the great birds swallowed him.

JIM
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
I <em>am</em> 'ere always.
</p>

<p>
BILL
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Why, Jim, don't you remember me? Why, you taught Bill to pick locks
years and years ago when he was a little boy, and had never learnt a
trade and hadn't a penny in the world, and never would have had but for
you, Jim. (<i>Jim stares vaguely</i>) I never forgot <em>you</em>, Jim. I
broke into scores of houses. And then I took on big houses. Out in the
country, you know, real big ones. I got rich, Jim, and respected by all
who knew me. I was a citizen, Jim, one who dwelt in our midst. And of
an evening, sitting over the fire, I used to say, "I am as clever as
Jim." But I wasn't, Jim. I couldn't climb like you. And I couldn't walk
like you on a creaky stair, when everything's quite still and there's a
dog in the house and little rattly things left lying about, and a door
that whines if you touch it, and someone ill upstairs that you didn't
know of, who has nothing to do but to listen for <em>you</em> 'cause she
can't get to sleep. Don't you remember little Bill?
</p>

<p>
JIM
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
That would be somewhere else.
</p>

<p>
BILL
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Yes, Jim, yes. Down on Earth.
</p>

<p>
JIM
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
But there isn't anywhere else.
</p>

<p>
BILL
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
I never forgot <em>you</em>, Jim. I'd be pattering away with my tongue,
in Church, like all the rest, but all the time I'd be thinking of you
in that little room at Putney and the man searching every corner of it
for you with a revolver in one hand and a candle in the other, and you
almost going round with him.
</p>

<p>
JIM
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
What is Putney?
</p>

<p>
BILL
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Oh, Jim, can't you remember? Can't you remember the day you taught me a
livelihood? I wasn't more than twelve, and it was spring, and all the
may was in blossom outside the town. And we cleared out No. 25 in the
new street. And next day we saw the man's fat, silly face. It was
thirty years ago.
</p>

<p>
JIM
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
What are years?
</p>

<p>
BILL
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Oh, <em>Jim</em>!
</p>

<p>
JIM
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
You see there isn't any hope here. And when there isn't any hope there
isn't any future. And when there isn't any future there isn't any past.
It's just the present here. I tell you we're stuck. There aren't no
years here. Nor no nothing.
</p>

<p>
BILL
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Cheer up, Jim. You're thinking of a quotation, "Abandon hope, all ye
that enter here." I used to learn quotations; they are awfully genteel.
A fellow called Shakespeare used to make them. But there isn't any
sense in them. What's the use of saying <i>ye</i> when you mean
<i>you</i>? Don't be thinking of quotations, Jim.
</p>

<p>
JIM
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
I tell you there is no hope here.
</p>

<p>
BILL
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Cheer up, Jim. There's plenty of hope there, isn't there? (<i>Points to
the Gate of Heaven</i>)
</p>

<p>
JIM
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Yes, and that's why they keep it locked up so. They won't let us have
any. No. I begin to remember Earth again now since you've been
speaking. It was just the same there. The more they'd got the more they
wanted to keep <em>you</em> from having a bit.
</p>

<p>
BILL
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
You'll cheer up a bit when I tell you what I've got. I say, Jim, have
you got some beer? Why, so you have. Why, <em>you</em> ought to cheer up,
Jim.
</p>

<p>
JIM
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
All the beer you're ever likely to see again. They're empty.
</p>

<p>
BILL (<i>half rising from the rock on which he has seated
himself, and pointing his finger at Jim as he rises; very
cheerfully</i>)
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Why, you're the chap that said there was no hope here, and you're
hoping to find beer in every bottle you open.
</p>

<p>
JIM
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Yes; I <em>hope</em> to see a drop of beer in one some day, but I
<i>know</i> I won't. Their trick <i>might</i> not work just once.
</p>

<p>
BILL
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
How many have you tried, Jim?
</p>

<p>
JIM
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Oh, I don't know. I've always been at it, working as fast as I can,
ever since&#8212;ever since&#8212;(<i>Feels his neck meditatively and up toward
his ear</i>) Why, ever since, Bill.
</p>

<p>
BILL
</p>

I don't know. Nothing's any use.

</p>

<p>
BILL
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Well, I don't know. But, Jim, what do you think I've got?
</p>

<p>
JIM
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
It isn't any good to you whatever it is. Not even if it is a ten-pound
note.
</p>

<p>
BILL
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
It's better than a ten-pound note, Jim. Jim, try and remember, Jim.
Don't you remember the way we used to go for those iron safes? Do you
remember anything, Jim?
</p>

<p>
JIM
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Yes, I am beginning to remember now. There used to be sunsets. And then
there were great yellow lights. And one went in behind them through a
swinging door.
</p>

<p>
BILL
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Yes, yes, Jim. That was the Blue Bear down at Wimbledon.
</p>

<p>
JIM
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Yes, and the room was all full of golden light. And there was beer with
light in it, and some would be spilt on the counter and there was light
in that too. And there was a girl standing there with yellow hair.
She'd be the other side of that door now, with lamplight in her hair
among the angels, and the old smile on her lips if one of them chaffed
her, and her pretty teeth a-shining. She would be very near the throne;
there was never any harm in Jane.
</p>

<p>
BILL
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
No, there was never any 'arm in Jane, Jim.
</p>

<p>
JIM
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
Oh, I don't want to see the angels, Bill. But if I could see Jane again
(<i>points in direction of laugh</i>) he might laugh as much as he
cared to whenever I wanted to cry. You can't cry here, you know, Bill.

BILL

Nothing is any good here.

<p>
BILL
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
I'll get in to Heaven, Jim. And you shall come with me because you
taught me a livelihood. I couldn't be happy there, like those angels,

You'll never get through those gates, Bill. You'll never do it.

They're only gold, Jim. Gold's soft like lead. Old Nut-cracker would do
it if they were steel.

You'll never do it, Bill.

it's a hundred million miles thick.

<p class="dialogue">
Can't be, Jim. These doors are meant to open outward. They couldn't do
that if they were more than four inches at the most, not for an
Archbishop. They'd stick.

<p>
JIM

<p class="dialogue">
You remember that great safe we broke open once, what had coal in it.
</p>

<p>
BILL
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
This isn't a safe, Jim, this is Heaven. There'll be the old saints with
their halos shining and flickering, like windows o' wintry nights.
(<i>Creak, creak, creak</i>) And angels thick as swallows along a
cottage roof the day before they go. (<i>Creak, creak, creak</i>) And
orchards full of apples as far as you can see, and the rivers of Tigris
and Euphrates, so the Bible says; and a city of gold, for those that
care for cities, all full of precious stones; but I'm a bit tired of
cities and precious stones. (<i>Creak, creak, creak</i>) I'll go out
into the fields where the orchards are, by the Tigris and the
Euphrates. I shouldn't be surprised if my old mother was there. She
never cared much for the way I earned my livelihood (<i>creak,
creak</i>), but she was a good mother to me. I don't know if they want
a good mother in there who would be kind to the angels and sit and
smile at them when they sang and soothe them if they were cross. If
they let all the good ones in she'll be there all right.
(<i>Suddenly</i>) Jim! They won't have brought me up against her, will
they? That's not fair evidence, Jim.
</p>

<p>
JIM
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
It would be just like them to. Very like them.
</p>

<p>
BILL
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
If there's a glass of beer to be got in Heaven, or a dish of tripe and
onions, or a pipe of 'bacca she'll have them for me when I come to her.
She used to know my ways wonderful; and what I liked. And she used to
know when to expect me almost anywhere. I used to climb in through the
window at any hour and she always knew it was me. (<i>Creak, creak</i>)
She'll know it's me at the door now, Jim. (<i>Creak, creak</i>) It will
be all a blaze of light, and I'll hardly know it's her till I get used
to it&#8230;. But I'll know her among a million angels. There weren't none
like her on Earth and there won't be none like her in Heaven&#8230;. Jim!
I'm through, Jim! One more turn, and old Nut-cracker's done it! It's
giving! It's giving! I know the feel of it. <em>Jim!</em>

Excuse me, sir. Excuse my stopping you. But I should be immensely
obliged to you if you would do me a very great favor. I have
unfortunately left my hat behind while calling at this house. It is
half under the long sofa, at the far end. If you could possibly be so
kind as to pretend you have come to tune the piano and fetch my hat for
me I should be enormously grateful to you.

Do I look like a murderer?

<p>
POET
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
No, of course not. I am only saying that you can safely trust me, for
not only does the statute book and its penalties rather tend to bore
me, but murder itself has always had a certain fascination for me. I
write delicate and fastidious lyrics, yet, strange as it may appear, I
read every murder trial, and my sympathies are always with the
prisoner.

Let us sit down and talk of things that matter, things that will be
remembered after a hundred years. (<i>They sit</i>) Regarded in this
light one sees at once the triviality of hats. But to die, and die
beautifully for a hopeless love, that is a thing one could make a lyric
about. That is the test of essential things&#8212;try and imagine them in a
lyric. One could not write a lyric about a hat.

<p>
CALLER
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
I don't care whether you could write a lyric about my hat or whether
you couldn't. All I know is that I am not going to make myself
absolutely ridiculous by walking about in London without a hat. Will
you get it for me or will you not?

I suppose it has an artistic decoration on it.

Yes, I think so.

POET

<p class="dialogue">
Then I decline to look at it or to go near it. I know these decorations
in cast iron. I once saw a pot-bellied Egyptian god, named B&#275;s, and
he was <em>meant</em> to be ugly, but he wasn't as ugly as these
decorations that the twentieth century can make with machinery. What
has a plumber got to do with art that he should dare to attempt
decoration?

I can think of nothing else. You don't look like a plumber or a

Then you will have to leave your hat to its altered destiny.

Why can't you think of a plan? If you're a poet, thinking's rather in
your line.

<p>
POET

<p class="dialogue">
If I could bring my thoughts to contemplate so absurd a thing as a hat
for any length of time no doubt I could think of a plan, but the very
triviality of the theme seems to scare them away.

I don't mean that. But you will make it up. You will forgive each
other, and you will marry her and have a family of noisy, pimply

POET

What is a hat! Will you sacrifice for it a beautiful doom? Think of
your bones, neglected and forgotten, lying forlornly because of
hopeless love on endless golden sands. "Lying forlorn!" as Keats said.
What a word! Forlorn in Africa. The careless Bedouins going past by
day, at night the lion's roar, the grievous voice of the desert.
</p>

<p>
CALLER
</p>

<p class="dialogue">
As a matter of fact, I don't think you're right in speaking of it as
desert. The Bosnians, I believe, are only taking it because it is
supposed to be the most fertile land in the world.

POET

What of that? You will not be remembered by geography and statistics,
but by golden-mouthed Romance. And that is how Romance sees Africa.

Think! Think! If you enter by that door you will never fall among the

call herself cruel in vain.

They shall be glad because they tell again the noble tradition of the
troubadours, and sad because they tell of your sorrowful destiny and of
your hopeless love.

I shall make legends also about your lonely bones, telling perhaps how
some Arabian men, finding them in the desert by some oasis, memorable
in war, wonder who loved them. And then as I read them to her, she
weeps perhaps a little, and I read instead of the glory of the soldier,
how it overtops our transitory&#8212;
